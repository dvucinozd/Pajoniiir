# PajoNiiiR BL-A1800

Standalone dual-deck DJ system built around a Pioneer DDJ-FLX4, a Seeed
Studio XIAO ESP32S3 control board and a JC4880P443C_I_W ESP32-P4 multimedia
board. It reads Rekordbox media directly and does not require a PC during
performance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The last matching P4/S3 signed-OTA rollout baseline is
> **`RC1-168-gb69f1b19`** (both boards on `ota_0`, S3 reported `valid`),
> deployed and boot/status-verified on 2026-07-21 with key `rel-001`; the bench
> state is identical to that rollout. It adds the unified ANLZ metadata loader,
> the structured microSD service journal with its read-only
> `GET /api/diagnostic-log`, and the master-output recorder with its Settings
> control and guarded `/api/recording` API. Accepted on hardware in this build:
> the recorder functional `.wav` capture (about 54 s, zero dropped frames) and
> the service journal. The latest **complete** functional hardware acceptance
> still remains **`RC1-123-g587cd7a1`** from 2026-07-14 — targeted Phase 20,
> Beat FX Flanger/Delay audio and the rest of the E1A set are outstanding — so
> the system is not yet production-ready. See
> [Documentation Status](docs/DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md) for the exact boundary.

## System at a Glance

| Device | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **Pioneer DDJ-FLX4** | Operator surface: transport, jogs, tempo, mixer, pads, cue and LEDs |
| **XIAO ESP32S3** | USB MIDI host, semantic event translator, LED bridge, FLX4 USB-headphone streamer and service OTA AP |
| **ESP32-P4 board** | Authoritative playback/deck state, Rekordbox library, LVGL UI, audio DSP/mixer and MAIN/cue routing |

The S3 normalizes FLX4 input but does not own playback state. The P4 makes all
authoritative deck, mixer, audio-position and LED decisions. Both boards use
the existing `0xA5` UART control link, extended with the `0xA6` bulk/status
layer. The detailed ownership and data flow are documented in
[Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Current Capabilities

- Two independent decks with Rekordbox library browsing and MP3, WAV and FLAC
  playback.
- FLX4 transport, jog/vinyl scratch, tempo and Master Tempo, mixer/EQ,
  headphone cue, hot cues, loops, beat jump/sync, Pad FX and Beat FX control.
  Beat FX Filter and Echo have recorded hardware acceptance; Flanger and the
  new one-shot Delay are software-tested and deployed, with focused physical
  audio/routing smoke still pending.
- Simultaneous PCM5102A RCA MAIN output and FLX4 USB headphone cue.
- P4-owned FLX4 LED feedback with reconnect and board-reboot resynchronization.
- LVGL Overview, Library, Hot Cues and Settings tabs, plus the optional P4
  Wi-Fi remote.
- Data-driven controller profiles loaded from SD or installed through the web
  UI; the built-in DDJ-FLX4 map remains the fallback. The web overwrite path is
  software-complete and still has pending hardware-acceptance rows.
- Signed dual-slot OTA, validation and rollback on both processors.

Detailed implementation and acceptance status belongs in
[Project Overview](docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md),
[Development Plan](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) and
[Documentation Status](docs/DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md), rather than in this
repository entry page.

## Interface

The captures are representative; small UI details may be newer in firmware.

The Hot Cues tab is implemented but does not yet have an archived screenshot.

## Build and Test

Required baseline: ESP-IDF v5.5 and the Espressif Python/toolchain environment;
host tests additionally require native GCC/Make. On Windows, initialize
ESP-IDF before building:

```powershell
$env:IDF_PATH = "C:\Espressif\frameworks\esp-idf-v5.5\"
. C:\Espressif\Initialize-Idf.ps1
```

Build each target from the repository root:

```powershell
cd firmware\control-board-s3
idf.py build

cd ..\main-deck-p4
idf.py build
```

Run the host regression suites from the repository root:

```powershell
.\tests\run_s3_host_tests.ps1
.\tests\run_p4_host_tests.ps1
```

Both default firmware configurations include the FLX4 USB-headphone path.
Build, flashing, signed release packaging and rollback procedures are covered
by [OTA Update](docs/OTA-UPDATE.md). Hardware bring-up and recurring acceptance
checks are in the [Startup Checklist](docs/STARTUP_CHECKLIST.md).

## Documentation

Start with the [complete documentation index](docs/README.md). The primary
operational documents are:

| Topic | Document |
| --- | --- |
| Product status and source-of-truth policy | [Documentation Status](docs/DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md) |
| Product shape and implemented scope | [Project Overview](docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) |
| S3/P4 responsibilities and data flow | [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| FLX4 inputs, outputs and acceptance ledger | [DDJ-FLX4 MIDI Map](docs/DDJ_FLX4_MIDI_MAP.md) |
| UART events and bulk/status transport | [Control Link Protocol](docs/CONTROL_LINK_PROTOCOL.md) |
| Wiring, USB and audio connections | [Hardware Wiring](docs/HARDWARE_WIRING.md) |
| Current phases and remaining engineering work | [Development Plan](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) |
| Open and accepted risks | [Risk Register](docs/RISK_REGISTER.md) |

Controller-profile schema/update guides, OTA records, validation evidence,
historical design decisions and upstream/vendor references are linked from the
documentation index. Dated design records explain intent; they do not override
current firmware or active operational documents.
